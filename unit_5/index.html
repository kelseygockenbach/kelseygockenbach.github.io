    <p>Birthed on the mean streets of Evanston, Illinois, Kelsey has always chosen the path less traveled. She attended the rigorous boarding school Culver Girlsâ€™ Academy before choosing to obtain a B.A. in English from the University of Washington. She then cut her teeth in the professional world as client manager for Stenger Government Relations in Madison, Wisconsin. Following her tenure in the government affairs world, she followed a dream of hers and took an extended solo trip to Melbourne, Australia. Upon re-entry to the northern hemisphere she found herself in Kalispell, Montana, working for the Center for Restorative Youth Justice as their public information manager.</p>
